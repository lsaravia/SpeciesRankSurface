## Online Appendix A: Model Description 

This model represent a continuum between hierarchical and neutral model in the same spirit as in \[@a2\]. The model is a stochastic cellular automata (CA) or also called interactive particle system \[@a1\]. In these kind of models space is discretized into a grid and only one individual can occupy a particular position. Each position represents an area fixed by the investigator to mimic the real system. Time is continuous so the update of the model is asynchronous. I update one randomly chosen site at a time and to perform one complete time interval $c J$ sites have to be updated, where $c$ is a constant that describes the overall rate at which transitions are occurring and $J$ is the size of the grid \[@a1\].   

The model use periodic boundary conditions, which makes the landscape a torus. It means that sites on the top edge of the grid are neighbors of those on the bottom edge, and sites on the right edge are neighbors of those on the left. With this choice I can avoid edge effects and is equivalent to thinking that the grid is embedded in a large community.

The size of the community is given by *J = dimX* x *dimY*, where *dimX* and *dimY* are the dimension of the grid. Thus *J* is the maximum number of individuals in the simulated area. 

In this model all individuals have almost the same parameters, besides they should belong to different species \[@a3\], and each species is assigned with a number. There are only two possible differences between species: 

* They may have a different frequency in the metacommunity and also different abundances in the local community.

* Hierarchical competition: species with lower numbers have a probability to replace species with higher numbers as in \[@a5\]. Thus a species with number 1 have a probability to replace species with number 2 and greater. The species with number 2 can replace species starting from 3. The probability of replacement is a parameter, when it is 0 replacement occurs only when a species dies.  

The colonization-competition and other trade-off are not explicitly included in the model. But a colonization-competition trade-off can be established if species numbering is arranged in inverse order as it's abundance $X_i$ in the metacommunity, the most competitive species (with number 1) will have the lowest migration rate and the less competitive will have the highest migration rate.  

There are four processes included in the model: death, local dispersal, and migration, starting with an empty site the following events can happen:

(1) With probability *m* an individual of a species *i* can migrate from the metacommunity at a rate proportional to its frequency $X_i$ in the metacommunity.

(2) When the grid is not full, individuals give birth with rate 1 to a new individual that disperse to the neighborhood with a dispersal kernel. Here I use an exponential kernel but an inverse power kernel \[@a4\] is also implemented in the software.

(2) Individuals die a rate $\mu$

(5) When an individual dies it is replaced by a migrant from metacommunity with probability $m$ and with probability $1-m$ by an individual from the neighborhood. The neighborhood is established using the dispersal kernel with average distance $d$. Once the grid is full it keeps full, because when an individual dies is immediately replaced by another. This is called the zero-sum assumption in neutral models. 

(6) If the individual does not die it can be replaced by an individual from the metacommunity or neighborhood as in (5), but an individual of species with number $k$ can replace and individual of a species $k+1$ with probability $\rho$. Thus a hierarchical ordering of species is established. When this probability is zero the model behavior is neutral.

The possible dispersal kernels are:

1. Exponential $p(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}$ with $mean=1/\lambda$ where $x\ge 0$.

2. Power law as defined in \[@a4\], $p(x) =  \frac{\alpha -1}{x_{min}} \left(\frac{x}{x_{min}} \right)^{-\alpha}$ with $mean =\frac{\alpha-1}{\alpha-2}x_{min}$ where $\alpha > 1$ and $x \ge x_{min}$. In all cases I used $x_{min} = 1$.
   

Simulations started with an empty grid that is colonized by migrants. They run until T=500, at this time the grid is completely occupied and steady state in richness was reached (Appendix Figure 1). Analyzing the Shannon Index $H$, some stochastic oscillations with differing periods appear (Appendix Figure 2). This adds some variability to repeated simulations for each parameter combination, and make the comparison of these communities more realistic, because natural communities generally suffer from disturbances that keeps them far from a steady state.

Table: Proportion of $R^2$ that are greater than 0.6 and 0.9 for simple spatial patterns. The $R^2$ are from linear regressions used to estimate generalized dimensions $D_q$ in simulated spatial patterns. Two different spatial patterns were used: *Regular* & *Randomized*, with two species abundance distributions: *Logseries* & *Uniform*, and using two approaches: *DqSRS* and *DqSAD* (See main text). *Side* is the side of grid used for simulate the spatial pattern.

Table: Proportion of $R^2$ that are greater than 0.6 and 0.9 for simulated communities with different degree of neutrality given by the parameter $\rho$. The $R^2$ are from linear regressions used to estimate generalized dimensions $D_q$. $D_q$ was estimated using two approaches: *DqSRS* and *DqSAD* (See main text). I used a Logseries metacommunity with 11, 86 and 341 species and *Side* is the side of the simulation grid.

\caption{Linear fit of generalized dimension ($D_q$) estimation from spatial patterns generated with a spatial neutral/hierarchical model with a 86 species logseries metacommunity and a simulation grid side=512 sites. \textit{Rho} is the parameter that determines the degree of neutrality. When this parameter is 0 the model is completely neutral and there is no competitive replacement of species. When $\rho$ is 1 competitive superior species always replaces inferior ones and the model is completely hierarchical. \textit{Species} is the number of species actually present plot.}

\caption{Generalized dimension spectra $D_q$ of spatial patterns generated with a spatial neutral/hierarchical model. $\rho$ is the parameter that determines the degree of neutrality. When this parameter is 0 the model is completely neutral and there is no competitive replacement of species. When $\rho$ is 1 competitive superior species always replaces inferior ones and the model is completely hierarchical. The simulations use a metacommunity with a logseries abundance distribution with 11,86 and 341 species. The simulation grid side is 512, and the other parameters are: MortalityRate=0.2, DispersalDistance=0.4 (2.5 grid units), ColonizationRate=0.001.}

\caption{Power of the Anderson-Darling test for the hypothesis of differences between simulated neutral/hierarchical communities. The test uses generalized dimensions curves calculated from SAD ($D_q^{SAD}$), generalized dimensions calculated from the species rank surfaces ($D_q^{SRS}$) and the species abundance distributions (SAD). The compared communities differ only in parameter $\rho$ (across panels) that determines the degree of neutrality/hierarchy. The number of comparisons to calculate the frequency is 2500 in all cases. Simulations use a metacommunity with a logseries abundance distribution with 11,86 and 341 species; a grid side of 512 sites, the other parameters are given in the main text.}
